1. Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an EfficientNetB0 backbone to classify dental images into seven different categories. The model is trained using an augmented dataset to improve its generalization capabilities.

2. Data Preparation
Mount Google Drive: The dataset is stored in Google Drive and is mounted in the Google Colab environment.
Unzipping the Dataset: The dataset is extracted from a zip file located in Google Drive to the working directory in Colab.
Image Data Generators:
ImageDataGenerator is used to augment the training images with transformations like rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping to increase the variety of the training data.
Separate generators are used for training, validation, and testing with appropriate preprocessing (e.g., rescaling pixel values).

3. Model Architecture
EfficientNetB0 Backbone: The model uses EfficientNetB0, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture pre-trained on ImageNet, as the base for feature extraction. The top layers are removed (include_top=False), and custom layers are added for the specific classification task.
Global Average Pooling: This layer replaces the fully connected layers typically found at the top of CNNs, reducing the spatial dimensions of the output feature map from the EfficientNetB0 model.
Skip Connection:
A skip connection is created from an earlier layer of the EfficientNetB0 model, specifically from the block6a_expand_activation layer.
The skip connection is passed through a Conv2D layer with a 1x1 kernel to match the shape of the output from the Global Average Pooling layer.
Dense Layers and Addition:
A Dense layer is applied to the pooled output of the EfficientNet model to increase the model's learning capacity.
The output of this dense layer is then added to the transformed skip connection output, combining information from different levels of the network.
Output Layer: The final dense layer uses the softmax activation function to classify the images into one of the seven categories.

4. Model Training
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as a metric.
The model is trained for 100 epochs with the training data, and its performance is validated using the validation set.

5. Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset, and the accuracy is reported.

6. Visualization
Class Distribution Plot: A bar plot is generated to show the distribution of the different classes in the training set, ensuring that the dataset is balanced or highlighting any imbalances.
Augmented Image Visualization: A sample of augmented images is displayed to visually verify the data augmentation process.

7. Usage Instructions
The code is designed to be run in Google Colab, which is well-suited for handling large datasets and leveraging the GPU for training deep learning models.
Users need to store their dataset in Google Drive, which the code will access after mounting the drive in Colab.

8. Dependencies
The project requires TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Google Colab for running the notebook.

9. Customization
The number of output classes and the data augmentation parameters can be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used.
The architecture can be modified by adding/removing layers or changing the base model to a different EfficientNet variant or another architecture like VGG or ResNet.

10. Credits
The project leverages the EfficientNetB0 model, which was developed by Google AI and is available through the Keras applications module.
